This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using minimal base images in Dockerfiles: unexpected runtime errors due to missing libraries or dependencies. The original Dockerfile uses `alpine:latest`, which is known for its small size but can be problematic if the application relies on libraries not included in the base image.  The solution demonstrates how to use a more robust base image or explicitly install necessary dependencies.
